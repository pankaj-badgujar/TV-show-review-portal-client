For running on local machines :
 
----------- For frontend: ----------- 

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

----------- For backend:------------

* The java server should have details of the connection of Mysql databaseof the local machine
 
* Also, the links in our code in git are those of heroku server's mySQL db. hence in order to run the project on local machine, these links have to be altered with localhost links.

* Most of our services at the client side 'Server' variable that can be changed to "http://localhost:8080/" and all other service functions can use the localhost server to make their calls.
